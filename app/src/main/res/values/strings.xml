    <string name="description_1">This mobile application helps you to determine how old your dog is in human years by using a simple calculation method provided by the American Kennel Club (AKC). Source:</string>
    <string name="description_2">Additionally, the program provides a fun and educational element by retrieving a random dog fact from the animality API.</string>

    <string name="disclaimer_title">Disclaimer</string>
    <string name="disclaimer_content">There is no universal rule for calculating your dog’s age since other factors such as breed also affect it, but you can get a close estimate by using this calculator.</string>
    <string name="functionality_content_1">As a general guideline, though, the American Veterinary Medical Association breaks it down like this:</string>
    <string name="functionality_content_2">15 human years equals the first year of a medium-sized dog’s life.</string>
    <string name="functionality_content_3">Year two for a dog equals about nine years for a human.</string>
    <string name="functionality_content_4">And after that, each human year would be approximately five years for a dog.</string>
